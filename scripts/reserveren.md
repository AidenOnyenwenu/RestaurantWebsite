# Explanation of the "reserveren.php" file

Once you have downloaded the file and placed it in the "htdocs" folder of XAMPP, you can use this script file. You only need to modify the values of the database connection to make it work.

Here are the steps to use the "reserveren.php" file:

Open the "reserveren.php" file. And edit the database connectie line with your database name, username and password. Also dont forget to update the table name and column names.

Place the file in the "htdocs" folder of your XAMPP installation directory. This is the location where XAMPP serves your web files. 

It now should work with database interactions.s
